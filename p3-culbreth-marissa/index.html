        <p>My first experience with communications was through the Brown Center for Leadership and Services at the University of Florida. I was here from May 2016 to April 2017. I was the tabling manager and my duties included:</p>

            </ul>
          </h3>
        <p>My first internship in Public Relations was with a start-up company called Taken Mate. I was with this company from February 2017 to April 2017. Taken Mate is an app based out of California. I, along with two other inters, were required to promote awareness of the app to the UF campus. My main duties were to:</p>

              <li>Operate and supervise those events</li>
              <li>Engage local charities and non-profits to work with Taken Mate</li>
              <li>Organize and conduct sorority and fraternity competitions</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>
        <p>My next internship was with PACE Center for Girls in Gainesville, Florida. I was with PACE from August 2017 to December 2017. I got my first major experience with graphic design here. My duties at PACE included:</p>
          <h3>

        <p>Since PACE, I took classes through UF to aquire more knowledge in Adobe applications, such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.</p>
        <p>My most recent internship was with the Humane Society of North Central Florida. I was with this organization from January 2019 to April 2019. Here, I was able to practice these skills onto a different audience. I was also working one-on-one with their development team to implement our goals and messages out into the community by creating designs for infographics and other ads and banners for social media to promote their services and events they were hosting. My duties here were to:</p>
          <h3>
