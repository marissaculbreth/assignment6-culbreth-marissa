      <p>Harry James Potter is the main character in a wildly popular serious of novels written by J.K. Rowling. Harry is a half-blood wizard, the only child and son of the late James and Lily Potter, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times.
      <p>In what proved to be a vain attempt to circumvent a prophecy that stated a boy born at the end of July of 1980 could be able to defeat him, Lord Voldemort tried to murder him when he was a year and three months old. Voldemort murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, shortly before attacking Harry. This early, unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall, marking the end of the First Wizarding War and to Harry henceforth being known as the "Boy Who Lived.</p>
